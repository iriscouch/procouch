# Professional CouchDB: Fire-and-forget database maintenance

Can you recall reading something about CouchDB views going stale? Do you feel psychic weight because you haven't been compacting regularly? Have you nowhere to turn as "deleted" documents clog up your disk? Do you want to scream if you hear one more word about *the security object*?

Pro CouchDB (or simply *Procouch*) has a simple message for you: **Relax.**

## Objective

Procouch monitors and maintains a CouchDB server. Just run it and never think about it again. Procouch keeps everything like you want it.

* The database is always compacted
* Views are always updated, compacted, and cleaned
* Very old deleted data is purged
* Staging design documents are prepped for deployment
* All of the above just works; but you can configure it for performance or for freshness as needed.

## Is it any good?

No. It is vaporware. Please see the TODO.md for the plan.
